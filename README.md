# Dinner SOS

## Description

Built a collaborative application to help people decide what to eat for dinner. If they are in the mood for a specific cuisine (ex. Thai food or pizza) they can search for that, and the application will populate the top locations near you, based on rating. If the user can't decide what to eat, there is a feature that they can choose that will randomly select a cuisine for them. 

## Features 
 - Used Materialized CSS framework to style the application 
 - Created a button to pop up a modal that includes a search input and the "pick for me" button 
 - Implemented third party APIs and local storage to collect and store the data 
 - The data from the third party APIs are returned to the user
